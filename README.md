# Opt Out : Comprehensive list of privacy-protecting settings across apps

Apps and web services such as Google / Facebook / Twitter / Snap / Instagram track us. This is a well-known fact. While disabling all tracking might be impossible, these companies (sometimes) provide less well-known ways of opting-out of sharing personal data and restricting visibility of personal information. These settings often take the form of <kbd>Send usage data in order to improve ads?</kbd> and are by default opt-in, so most users are not aware of them. This list aims to collate information about all the settings you can disable in order to decrease the amount of personal data you share with these apps. Note that if you really, truly care about anonymizing your web activities, you should probably avoid logging into these apps altogether and use tools like the [Tor browser](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en) and the [Signal messaging app](https://whispersystems.org/). Using extensions like [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) / [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) helps. The ways mentioned here simply minimize the amount of personal data you send to companies (using settings *they* provide) while still using their products.  

The oft-touted rationale behind tracking your web activities is to provide you with a better experience, such as by serving you customized ads. You might want that, and it is your choice and trade-off to make. The purpose of this list is to increase awareness about that choice - to let you know the means with which to deliberately exercise it. 

The best way to learn more about how data about you is collected is to read the app's Privacy Policy. A link to each company's privacy policy is included under its section.
