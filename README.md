# Opt Out : Comprehensive list of privacy-protecting settings across apps

Apps and web services such as Google / Facebook / Twitter / Snap / Instagram track us. This is a well-documented fact. While disabling all tracking might be impossible, these companies (sometimes) provide less-well-documented ways of opting-out of sending personal data to them. Note that if you really, truly care about anonymizing your web activities, you should probably avoid logging into these apps altogether and use tools like the [Tor browser](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en) and the [Signal messaging app](https://whispersystems.org/). Using extensions like [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) / [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) helps. The settings mentioned here simply help to minimize the amount of personal data you send to companies while still using their products.  

The oft-touted rationale behind tracking your web activities is to provide you with a better experience, such as by serving you customized ads. Perhaps you want that, and that is fine. It is your choice and trade-off to make. The purpose of this list is to increase awareness about that choice - to let you know the means with which to exercise it. 

The best way to learn more about how data about you is collected is to read the app's Privacy Policy. A link to each company's privacy policy is included under its section.
